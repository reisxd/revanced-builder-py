# revanced-builder-py
 A Python ReVanced Builder that makes it easier to build [supported apps](https://github.com/revanced/revanced-patches).

# Why?

I made this for my school project. Don't worry, the orginal [ReVanced Builder](https://github.com/reisxd/revanced-builder) is going nowhere.

# How do I use it?

Just download the [latest release](https://github.com/reisxd/revanced-builder-py/releases/latest) and simply run it.

Note that it'll require JDK >17 and ADB if you're gonna do a rooted installation.
